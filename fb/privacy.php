Usage of a cookie is in no way linked to any   personally identifiable information while on our site. We use both session ID   cookies and persistent cookies. For the session ID cookie, once the user closes   their browser, the cookie simply terminates. A persistent cookie is a small text   file stored on the user's hard drive for an extended period of time. </p>
<p class="style2">For instance, by setting a cookie on our site, the user would not have to log   in a password more than once, thereby saving time while on our site. Cookies are   placed on the registration and login page. If a user rejects the cookie, the site access may be limited. Cookies can also enable us to track and target the interests of our   members to enhance the experience on our site. </p>
<p class="style2">The billing copmpanies mentioned above may also use cookies,  however, we have no access to or control over these cookies. </p>
<H2 class="style2"><strong>Log Files</strong> </H2>
<p class="style2">We use IP addresses to analyze trends, administer the site, monitor fraud   and gather broad demographic information for aggregate use. </p>
<p class="style2">IP addresses are not linked to personally identifiable information. </p>
<H2 class="style2"><strong>Sharing</strong> </H2>
<p class="style2">We may share aggregated demographic information with our partners, billing companies and   advertisers. This is not linked to any personal information that can identify   any individual person. These parties are not allowed to use personally identifiable information   except for the purpose of providing these services. </p>

<p class="style2">We will disclose personal information about our members if and when is   required by law enforcement or to comply with a current judicial proceeding, a court order or legal   process served upon us.. </p>
<H2 class="style2"><strong>Links</strong> </H2>
<p class="style2">This web site contains links to other sites. Please be aware that we  are not responsible for the privacy practices of such other   sites. We encourage our members to be aware when they leave our site and to read   the privacy statements of each and every web site that collects personally   identifiable information. This privacy statement applies solely to information   collected by this Web site. </p>
<H2 class="style2"><strong>Chat Rooms, Message Boards, and Public Forums</strong> </H2>
<p class="style2">Please keep in mind that whenever you voluntarily disclose personal   information online - for example on message boards, through e-mail, or in chat   areas - that information can be collected and used by others. By   posting personal information online that is publicly accessible, you may receive   unsolicited messages from other parties in return. We do not disclose   any of our members' personal information to other members or on the public areas of the site. </p>
<H2 class="style2"><strong>Security</strong> </H2>
<p class="style2">We take  every precaution to protect our members' information. When   members submit sensitive information via the website, your information is   protected both on and off-line. </p>
<p class="style2">When our registration/order form asks members to enter sensitive information   (such as credit card number), that information is encrypted and is protected   with the best encryption software in the industry - SSL. While on a secure page,   such as our order form, the lock icon on the bottom of Web browsers such as   Netscape Navigator and Microsoft Internet Explorer becomes locked, as opposed to   un-locked, or open, when you are just 'surfing'. </p>
<p class="style2">While we use SSL encryption to protect sensitive information online, we also   do everything in our power to protect user-information off-line. All membership information, not just the sensitive information mentioned above, is   restricted in our offices. Only employees who need the information to perform a   specific job (for example, our billing clerk or a customer service   representative) are granted access to personally identifiable information. Our   employees must use password-protected screen-savers when they leave their desk.   When they return, they must re-enter their password to re-gain access to your   information. Furthermore, ALL employees are kept up-to-date on our security and   privacy practices. Every quarter, as well as any time new policies are added,   our employees are notified and/or reminded about the importance we place on   privacy, and what they can do to ensure our customers' information is protected.   Finally, the servers that we store personally identifiable information on are   kept in a secure environment, behind a locked cage. Please contact support below if you have any other question regarding security issues. </p>
<H2 class="style2"><strong>Keeping  Personal Information up to date:</strong> </H2>
<p class="style2">If a members personally identifiable information changes (such as their email address), or if a user no longer desires to be member of the site we provide a way to correct,   update or deactivate members' personally identifiable information. This can   usually be done on the member's profile web page by editing their profile and   submitting their request. All data is then updated in our system. </p>
<p class="style2">In order to cancel an upgraded membership members should submit a request to the billing company that handled the transaction in the first instance. Alternatively, members should contact support below to request cancellation of their upgraded account, Should a member wish to remove the account entirely, a link is provided on the profile page to do this after confirmation. </p>
<H2 class="style2"><strong>Marketing choices </strong> </H2>
<p class="style2">Our members are given the opportunity to 'opt-out' of having their information   used for purposes not directly related to our site during registration. If they   wish not to receive email or newsletters they can opt-out within the email options web page of the members area and also by notifying support. </p>
<H2 class="style2"><strong>Notification of Changes</strong> </H2>
<p class="style2">If at any point we decide to use personally identifiable information in a   manner different from that stated at the time it was collected, we will notify   members by way this page.  members will have a choice as to whether or not we use   their information in this different manner. We will use information in   accordance with the privacy policy under which the information was collected. </p>
